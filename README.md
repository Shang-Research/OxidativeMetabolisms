This repository provides the Python code used in the paper "Oxidative Metabolisms Catalyzed Earth's Oxygenation" by Haitao Shang, Daniel Rothman, and Gregory Fournier. 
The "Analyses of HGT Events" folder provides the Python code (i.e., "Analyses of HGT events.ipynb" file) used to compute and construct the probability distributions of the youngder and older bounds for the ages of the HGT events and to plot Figrue 3 in the paper. Other files in this folder contain the data or auxiliary information used by the "Analyses of HGT events.ipynb" file. 
The "Analyses of Diversification Rates" folder provides the Python code (i.e., "Analyses of Diversification Rates.ipynb" file) used to analyze and construct the BVMO diversification rates and to plot Figrue 4 in the paper. The data used by the "Analyses of Diversification Rates.ipynb" file are provided in "Gene Tree Age Posteriors.datedist.zip".
The "Supplement Data" folder provides the protein seuqneces, reconstructed and rooted species and gene tree files, and chronograms used and obtained in our study.
